/*
Java collections framework represents a hierarchy of set of interfaces and
classes that are used to manipulate group of objects.
		  
Collections are generally used for storing different type objects (student objects, bike objects, car objects, bank objects)
but if you want to store only one type objects nothing but homogeneous objects (student objects) then use Generics.

Need of Collections in Java:
	Collection is a java object that is used to store homogeneous & heterogeneous, duplicate & unique objects without size limitation and it is useful for carrying multiple objects 
  at a time from one application to another application as method argument and return type with single name across all layers of the project (MVC) .
	
	java.util package contains several classes to group/collect homogeneous and heterogeneous objects without size limitation. These classes usually collection framework classes.
				
	Collections framework classes are divided into two parts
		1) Collection--------> group objects without mappings
		2) Map --------------> group objects with mapping
		
	Objects that we can store in two ways
		1) array format   ->    index based
		2) table format   ->    (key, value) pair
		
	In which situations we must choose which format collection?
		Choose array format
		-> When identity is not required and 
		-> less number of searching and removing operations
		
	Choose table format 
		-> when identity is required and 
		-> more number of searching and removing operations.
		
	we can perform 9 operations on collection object
		1) Adding bottles
		2) Counting
		3) Printing
		
		4) Searching
		5) retrieving
		6) removing
		
		7) inserting
		8) replacing
		9) sorting
		
	In every collection class we must have
		1. memory for storing objects.
		2. methods to perform above 9 operations.
	
	
	Problems with all array objects
		1.	It allows us to store only same type of elements.
		2. It is fixed size ( can not grow its capacity, fixed in length and size ).
		3. Does not have inbuilt methods for performing different operations.
		4. different formats -> allows us to store only in one formats that index based, it does not have identity.
		5. different orders -> allows us to store only in one order insertion order, but we have so many orders( Sorting order, Last In First Order, First In First Order, Sequ  retrieving, Random retrieving.)
		
	Totally we have 18 Collections framework classes.
		
		1.0v    ----> Collections API ---> 2 classes and 1 interfaces ,   Legacy Collections means Old Collections
		
		1.	Vector   ( c ) ---> It is used for storing  multiple objects in IO( insertion order) with index (array format).
		2.	Stack    (c) ----> It is class, sub class of Vector. It is used for retrieving multiple objects in LIFO ( Last In First Out order).
		3.	Dictionary (ac) ---> It is an abstract class, super class of Hashtable.
		4.	Hashtable  (c)  ----->It is  used for storing objects with mapping (table format).
		5.	Properties (c)  -----> It is class. It is used for storing objects with mapping and used for storing those properties permanently in a file.
		3. Enumeration (I) ----> It is an interface. It is a cursor object. it is used for retrieving objects from the underlying collection objects.
		
		
		1.2 v ---->  new Collection classes
		Vector has 4 problems ::																																			Solutions:
		1. It is synchronized, slow in execution.																												ArrayList.  (Not Synchronized, so execution is fast)
		2. slow(gives less performance) in insert and remove operations.																LinkedList. (Provides fast execution in inserting and removing )
		3. can not stop duplicates.																																	    HashSet.     (it allows only unique objects).
		4. can not sort objects.																																			  TreeSet.      (it stores objects in sorting order).
		
		Hashtable has 3 problems ::
		1. It is Synchronized, slow in execution.																												HashMap.   (It is not Synchronized, so execution is fast).
		2. It can not store objects in sorting order.																										TreeMap.    (Stores entries in sorting order).
		3. It can not store objects with weak references.																								WeakHashMap. (Stores keys with weak references).
		
		
		Enumeration has 2 problems ::
		1. method names are very lengthy.
		 																						for both problems of  Enumerations ----------->	Iterator <----- ListIterator.
		2. can not remove objects while iterating.
		
		
	From Java 1.2 onwards java.util package classes are called Collections Framework, because all these classes are working for solving the same problem that is 
		collecting objects without size and type limitations.
		
	In all collection classes internally uses array object to store multiple objects and provides methods to perform all above 9 operations dynamically.
		
		
		What is the object used inside all collection for storing objects?
		1.	java.lang.Object[].
		
		All collection classes will provide methods to perform different operations such as adding, retrieving, removing, replacing objects in Object[] without size limitations.
		
		In four ways we can store data in JVM temporarily
		1. By using variable.           --------------->  To store single value (or) single object
		2. By using class object.     --------------->   To store multiple values of particular real-world objects
		3. By using array object.    --------------->    To store fixed number of multiple values (or) multiple objects of same type.
		4. By using collection object.  ------------>   To store same or different type of multiple values (or) multiple objects without size limitation.
		
		
		In Java 1.4v we got more three classes to solve the problems of HashSet and HashMap
		
		HashSet has one problem
		1) It can not maintain objects insertion order
		Solution ------------>      LinkedHashSet is given to store objects in insertion order.
		
		HashMap has two problems
		1) It can not maintain entries insertion order.
		Solution ------------>     LinkedHashMap is given to store entries in insertion order.
		
		2) It always can not store entries in reference wise hash code. means it can store objects based on data and object reference.
		Solution ------------>     IdentityHashMap is given to store entries in reference wise hash code order
		
		Note:
		-> LHS is the sub class of HS.
		-> LHM is the sub class of HM.
		-> IHM is individual class, not sub class of HM.
		
	New classes added in Java 5 version ::
		In Java 5, Queue interface and its subclasses are added to create Queue based collection objects.
		
		Also we got two more new collections
		EnumSet and EnumMap
		for storing an enum's Named Constants.
		
		Also a sub package "java.util.concurrent" is added with new collection classes to support synchronized based collection for
		performing concurrency operations with parallel processing.
		
		
		Vector						---->	It stores the objects in Insertion Order in Multi Threading / Thread Safety / Synchronized environment.
		
		Stack						----> It retrieves the objects in Last In First Out order
		
		ArrayList					----> It stores the objects in Insertion Order with index in Single Tread Model application where thread safety and synchronization is not required.
		
		LinkedList				----> It stores the objects in Insertion Order, but if more operations are inserting and removing then we use this.
		
		HashSet					----> For storing only unique objects / for stopping duplicates.
		
	  LinkedHashSet			----> For storing unique objects in Insertion Order.
		 
		TreeSet						----> For storing unique objects in Sorting Order.
		
		EnumSet					---->	Storing only enum named constants as elements.
		
		PriorityQueue			---->	For retrieving objects in First In First Out Order from beginning.
		
		ArrayDqueue			---->	For retrieving objects in First In First Out order from both ends.
		
	  Concurrent Collec	---->	For concurrency parallel processing.
		
		=============================================================================================================
		
		HashTable				----> storing objects with mapping in MultiThread Model application with Thread Safety / Synchronization
		
		Properties					----> For saving entries in a file permanently.
		
		HashMap					----> Storing objects with mapping in Single Thread Model application or Method Local operations.
		
		LinkedHashMap		----> Storing objects with mapping in Insertion Order
		
		TreeMap					----> Storing entries in Sorting Order.
		
		WeakHashMap			---->	For Storing entries with weak references.
		
		IdentityHashMap		---->	For Storing entries with references wise hash code.
		
		EnumMap				---->	For Storing enum named constants as keys.
		
		Concurrent Map		---->	For concurrency parallel processing.
		
		
		Language level new features
		=====================
		 * 			1)	Generics			----> for creating homogeneous collections
		 * 					< >  ----> Generic parameter.
		 * 					< T>  ---> Type
		 * 					< E > --->  Element
		 * 					< K > --->  Key
		 * 					< N > --->  Number
		 * 					< V > --->  Value
		 * 			2) AB and AUB	---->	for storing primitive values in collection.
		 * 			3) for each loop	---->	for retrieving objects from collection with less code.
		 * >>> Where ever object is coming there is generic terminology called Element  i.e.,  E represent object
		 * 
		 * New classes added in Java 6 version ::
		 * ===========================
		 * In Java 6, two new interfaces 
		 * 					NavigableSet & NavigableMap are added 
		 * 					as sub interfaces of SortedSet and SortedMap
		 * 					for providing more navigation methods to TreeSet and TreeMap.
		 * 
		 * New features in Java 7 version ::
		 * =======================
		 * Language level new feature 
		 * 				Generic type inference(copy)
		 * 				1.5, 1.6v
		 * 							ArrayList<String> al = new ArrayList<String>();
		 * 
		 * 				1.7v
		 * 							ArrayList<String> al = new ArrayList();
		 * 
		 * 
		 * New classes added in Java 8 version ::
		 * ===========================
		 * In Java 8, new classes are added for retrieving object with some addition features like filtering, mapping etc....
		 * 
		 * Those new classes are called Functional API and Stream API and all those classes are defined in a new package java.util.function and java.util.stream.
		 * 
		 * Another new utility classes are added with name 
		 * 		1) Optional<T>
		 * 		2) Objects<T>
		 * 		3) Collectors<T>
		 * 
		 *
		 *	New enhance added in Java 9 version for collection API
		 *=========================================
		 *	We got factory methods to create immutable collection objects with less code with the name "of(-)".
		 *
		 *	Stream API improvements by adding more methods.
		 *
		 *	New enhancements are added in Java 10v for collection API ::
		 *============================================
		 *	We got factory methods to create unmodifiable collection objects by copying elements from other collection with the name copyOf(-).
		 *
		 *	Collections framework classes are runtime polymorphic classes ::
		 *================================================
		 *	All above 18 classes are categorized into four groups by declaring 4 super interfaces. They are
		 *					Set, List, Queue, Map.
		 *
		 *	Set, List & Queue are grouped as one type declaring a super interface called Collection.
		 *
		 *	java.util package classes are runtime polymorphic classes, because all these classes are created under two super interfaces.
		 *		1)	Collection interface and 
		 *		2)	Map interface.
		 *	
		 *	So, in a project if needed, we can interchange one collection object with another collection object easily and also we can copy elements and entries easy
		 *	from one collection to another.
		 *	
		 *Collections Framework hierarchies ::
		 *===========================
		 *	In Java 1.2 all collection classes are grouped into two hierarhies with the name Collections Framework, they are
		 *		1. Collection	hierarchy
		 *		2. Map				hierarchy
		 *
		 *	Collection & Map are two root interfaces of collections framework classes.
		 *
		 *	Collection interface subclasses are meant for storing objects in array format without mapping.
		 *
		 *	Map interface subclasses are meant for storing objects with mapping, meaning in (key, value) pair table format.
		 *
		 * Is Map sub interface of Collection, if no why?
		 * 	Map is not sub interface of Collection, because both are different behavioural Objects.
		 * 
		 *
		 * 1) Legacy Collection --------------------------->  1.0 v
		 * 2) Collections Framework collections ------>   1.2 v
		 * 3) Generic Collections ------------------------->   1.5 v
		 * 	
		 *Three words ::
		 *1) collection ------------------> just a word, group of objects either without mapping or with mapping.
		 *2) Collection -----------------> root interface of collection hierarchy without mapping.
		 *3) Collections ----------------> a class, utility class, contains several static methods to perform some operation on Collection and Map objects commonly.
		 *
		 * Different categories of classes available in java.util.package 
		 * ===========================================
		 * In java.util.package we have 6 different groups of classes

		 * Steps to develop collection programming ::
		 * ===============================
		 * 1. Add java.util package import statement
		 * 2. Create appropriate collection object based on the format and order in which objects you want to store.
		 * 3. Invoke collection methods for storing and counting objects
		 * 4. Pass/return this collection object to next/previous layer program(if needed) as argument and return value.
		 * 5. Invoke collection method for searching, retrieving, removing, inserting, replacing objects in this collection in this second class.
		 * 6. Finally store collection of  objects permanently either in a file or in a DB or printing on console to end user.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Collection interface methods ::
		 * ======================
		 * 1.public boolean isEmpty()    ----> checking collection is empty or not
		 * 
		 * 2. public boolean add(E e)    -----> to add single object
		 * 3. public boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)   ----> to add multiple objects
		 * 
		 * 4. public boolean remove(E e)  -----> to remove single object
		 * 5. public boolean removeAll(Collection<? extends E> c)   ----> to remove multiple objects.
		 * 6. public void    clear()               ---> to clear(empty) the collections
		 * 
		 * 7.	public boolean contains(E e)  -----> checking one object
		 * 8. public boolean containsAll(Collection<? extends E> c)					-----> checking for multiple objects
		 * 
		 * 9. public boolean retainsAll(Collection<? extends E>		c)		----->  to get the copy of multiple objects
		 * 
		 * 10. public int size()     --------> counting objects
		 * 
		 * 11. public Iterator iterator() ------------->  for retrieving objects
		 * 
		 * 12. public int hashCode() --------->   for retrieving identity
		 * 
		 * 13. public boolean equals(Object obj)		-------> for comparing objects
		 * 
		 * 14. public T[] toArray()		----> to convert type object to Array object for stopping growing its size
		 * 
		 * 15. public T[] toArray(T[] t)   ----> to convert specific type of object to Array.

		 *  		objects, and also for searching, retrieving & removing current elements from Set and Map based collection.
		 *  2. Inside put() method, 
		 *  		-First hashCode() method is called
		 *  		-Next "==" operator is used
		 *  		-Finally equals() method is called
		 *  3. hashCode() method is used for storing related objects as one group by separating them from other group of objects in the same map. so that
		 *  		comparisons will be decreased, execution will become fast. Execution becomes fast because currently adding object will be compared to only 
		 *  		with its "hash code" objects in this map but not with all object available in the Map.
		 *  4. Further "==" operator is used for comparing the adding objects with its hashCode objects using reference.
		 *  5. Finally equals() method is used for comparing the adding object with its hashcode objects using state ( using reference if not overridden ).
		 *  
		 *  add()/put() method algorithm in HS/LHS/HM/LHM/Ht ::
		 *  =========================================
		 *  6. For storing objects, HashMap is internally uses "hash table " data structure.
		 *  7. "hash table" internally uses another data structure called "bucket" for grouping the same hashcode objects as one group.
		 *  8. bucket is the collection of elements whose hashCode is same. This bucket is also a collection object. its LinkedList( from  1.8 onwards it's Binary Tree ).
		 *  	Initially bucket is LinkedList. When number of entries are >= 8 then LinkedList is changed to binary tree for fast comparison.
		 *  9. Bucket is used for storing same hash code objects as one group. so that comparing and searching will be fast because currently adding element
		 *  	will be compared only with this object's hashcode group of objects.
		 *  10. new bucket will be created only for every new hashcode object. Then this object will be added to this bucket directly without any comparisons.
		 *  11. if bucket is already available with this currently adding entry's key hashcode then put() will check whether this entry is unique or duplicate by
		 *  		using "==" operator and equals() method.
		 *  12. If "==" operator returns "true", adding entry is duplicate on key reference, then key is not added, but its mapped old value is replaced by this new value.
		 *  13. If "==" operator returns "false", adding entry is unique based on reference, but it may be duplicate based on state. So, put() method will call
		 *  		equals() method for comparing entry using its content.
		 *  14. if equals() method also returns false, entry is added in the same bucket, means it is unique entry on data wise.
		 *  15. if equals() method returns true, adding entry is duplicate on key state wise, then key is not added, but its mapped old value is replaced by
		 *  		 this new value.
		 *  16. The hash table data structure is internally implemented by using Node class array.
		 *  17. The bucket(single linked list with Node objects) is created with given entry(key and value) and its reference is stored in the table(Node[] object)
		 *  		in its one of the locations.
		 *  18. To find the location to store in this entry's node object, inside put() method, key object hash code is divided by the HashMap capacity( Ex: key.hC()%16).
		 *  		This division's reminder value is nothing but the index numbet of the location for storing this entry.
		 *  
		 *  
		 * >> changing each object location when capacity is changed then this process is called rehashing.
		 *  
		 *
		 * Working with TreeSet and TreeMap  classes & Comparable and Comparator interfaces ::
		 *  If we want to store objects in sorting order we must use TreeSet and TreeMap.
		 *  
		 *  TreeSet stores objects in sorting order either in ascending order (or) in descending order (or) insertion order(or) reverse insertion order based on the
		 *  adding objects given algorithm.
		 *  
		 *  TreeSet does not have default sorting order.
		 *  
		 *  The sorting order should be defined by the application programmer, in the class whose objects are adding to TreeSet.
		 *  
		 *  So the default sorting order of TS is the default sorting order of the objects those are adding to TreeSet.
		 *  
		 *  For Storing objects in sorting order, 
		 *   TreeSet Internally uses either of the below two interfaces
		 *   	1. Comparable 	or
		 *   	2. comparator
		 *   
		 *   Comparable<T> interface has below method
		 *   		public int compareTo(Object o1, Object o2)
		 *   			- It is used for providing default sorting logic
		 *  
		 *  Comparator<T> interface has below method
		 *  		public int compare(Object o1, Object o2)
		 *  			- it is used for providing custom logic.
		 *  
		 *  TS uses these two interfaces, because through interface we can force subclass programmer to implement a method logic.
		 *  
		 *  TS requires the sorting order logic that must be provided by adding object class programmer, the objects sorting order logic will be changed from one
		 *  type of object to another type of object.
		 *  
		 *  Therefore to force adding object class programmer to implementing sorting order logic, TS uses interfaces.
		 *  
		 *  We must override compareTo() and compare() methods with the logic to return an int value either  0/+ve/-ve
		 *  	1. If we return 0, second object will not be stored because TS will consider it as duplicate object.
		 *  	2.If we return +ve value, second object will be stored 
		 *  			RIGHT to first object, because
		 *  			TS will consider it as Bigger object
		 *  	
		 *  	3. If we return -ve value, second object will be stored
		 *  		LEFT to first object, because
		 *  		TS will consider it as Smaller Object.
		 *  
		 *  TS.add() method internally calls these interfaces methods, and those methods are executed from adding object class.
		 *  
		 *  Then based on the value returned from these methods, 
		 *  TS will sort objects as below
		 *  - If returned value is 0 , 
		 *  	object e2 is not added.
		 *  
		 *  - If returned value is -ve, 
		 *  	object e2 is added LEFT to TS element e1.
		 *  
		 *  - If returned value is +ve,
		 *  	object e2 is added RIGHT to TS element e1.
		 *  
		 *
		 *
		 *What is the meaning of natural sorting order and custom sorting order?
		 *
		 *The sorting order logic is that is implemented in adding object class by deriving the Comparable
		 *interfaces is called natural sorting order.
		 *
		 *The sorting order logic that is implemented in different class by deriving the comparator interface is called custom sorting order logic.
		 *
		 *We will implement custom sorting order logic in different class, but not in adding object's class.
